Generative Adversarial networks are minimax games in which a generator (smooth criminal) tries to fool a discriminator (the cops) into believing the world is flat.

In this zero-sum game, eventually neither player can improve their position with any actions. This Nash equilibrium brings training to completion when: 
  * the generator makes perfect fakes
  * the discriminator has a 50/50 chance of identifying real or fake

At that point the generator can only decrease the quality of its outputs by making changes to its routine.
